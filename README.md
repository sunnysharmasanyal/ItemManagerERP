2.7. PROCESS MODELS USED WITH JUSTIFICATION
ACCESS CONTROL FOR DATA WHICH REQUIRE USER AUTHENTICATION

The following commands specify access control identifiers and they are typically used to authorize and authenticate the user (command codes are shown in parentheses) 
USER NAME (USER)
The user identification is that which is required by the server for access to its file system. This command will normally be the first command transmitted by the user after the control connections are made (some servers may require this). 
PASSWORD (PASS) 
This command must be immediately preceded by the user name command, and, for some sites, completes the user's identification for access control. Since password information is quite sensitive, it is desirable in general to "mask" it or suppress type out
